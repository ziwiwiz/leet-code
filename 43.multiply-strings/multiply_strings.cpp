 *
 * Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return
 * the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.
 *
 * Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs
 * to integer directly.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
 * Output: "6"
 * Example 2:
 * Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
 * Output: "56088"
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200
 * num1 and num2 consist of digits only.
 * Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0
 * itself.
